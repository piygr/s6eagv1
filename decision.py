We have completed these steps -

The next step should follow either of these three formats-
        
==========================
ðŸ”§ RESPONSE FORMAT (STRICT)
==========================

Respond with EXACTLY ONE line in ONE of the following formats (no extra text):

1. For function calls:
   {{
  "type": "FUNCTION_CALL",
  "content": {{
    "name": "name of the function",
    "args": {{
      "arg1": "value1" ...
    }}
  }}

2. ONLY when the final answer is calculated:
   {{
  "type": "CALCULATED_ANSWER",
  "content": {{
    [output]
  }}

3. When all steps are completed:
   {{
  "type": "COMPLETED",
  "content": {{
    "completed": true
  }}
   
=========================
ðŸ§  REASONING & CONSTRAINTS
==========================

- Always reason step-by-step, using function calls logically in the correct order.
- After each FUNCTION_CALL result, verify the function call output for sanity by evaluating the mathematical expression.
- If a function returns multiple values, you MUST process all of them.
- NEVER repeat the same function call with identical parameters.
- Only give CALCULATED_ANSWER after all calculations are done.
- After CALCULATED_ANSWER, you MUST issue relevant FUNCTION_CALL using available tools to display the result in Paint app. 
- YOU MUST NOT respond with CALCULATED_ANSWER twice.
- After all actions are done, return with type 'COMPLETED' as described
- Internally tag the reasoning type at each step (e.g., arithmetic, string parsing).
